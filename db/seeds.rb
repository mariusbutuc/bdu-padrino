  { author: 'Madhavi', content: 'The lessons in Hadoop Fundamentals I are well organized. The lessons start with an overview of the topic being covered, before going into the finer details. <br />It would however have been helpful if the lessons could cover applications of each of the topics. For example, the scenarios where usage of pig/hive/jaql is well suited. It would also be useful if mapreduce lab sessions could go over the code for wordcount program in detail before running the program. It would also be useful if the lab transcripts could give examples of what parts need to be modified to execute certain sections in the lab tutorial, in the cloud. <br />Overall, the course is well thought out and gives all the details needed to learn the fundamentals of Hadoop.' },
